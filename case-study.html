            <p>With all the challenges people face, having access to their medical records shouldn't be one of them. After researching about our current healthcare system, I established issues I would set out to fix, project goals, and who my users were.</p>

            <h2><span class="NumberHealth">02</span> Problem</h2>
            <p>In a time where more and more young people move away for a job opportunity, not having possession over your medical data is not just annoying; it is also dangerous. Once users leave their healthcare provider, they will lose the collected data about themselves because it will stay with their former provider, instead of going with them. Moreover, what happens then is that the continuity of medical care is at risk when users cannot provide a complete medical history to health professionals they see for the first time.</p>

          <div class="Solution">
            <h2><span class="NumberHealth">03</span> Solution</h2>

                  The weakness is the conservative interface and that there is no mobile version available,
                  which gives them opportunities if they would re-design the interface and as well create a mobile app.

                serious threat to Google Drive.

                Overall all participants agreed that it looks like a health application, the colors are suited well for it.

            <h2><span class="NumberHealth">05</span> Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Healthvitae achieves its goal to give users fast and easy access to their medical records. Over the course of many testing sessions and design iterations, we developed a user interface that is simplistic yet modern and easy to operate.
            While I'm pleased with the final solution, I wish my early testing phase would have worked out better. But running into those issues also taught me to do not the same mistakes next time and I also learned the big importance of user testing and what impact that has on your product.</p>

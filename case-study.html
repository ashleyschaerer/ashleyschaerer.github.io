            <h2>01 Intro</h2>
            <p>With all the challenges people face, having <br> access to their medical records shouldn't <br> be one of them. After researching about <br> our current healthcare system, I <br> established issues I would set out to fix, <br> project goals, and who my users were.</p>

          <section class="Problem">
            <h2>02 Problem</h2>
            <p>In a time where more and more young people move away for a job opportunity, not having possession over your medical data is not just annoying; it is also dangerous. Once users leave their healthcare provider, they will lose the collected data about themselves because it will stay with their former provider, instead of going with them. Moreover, what happens then is that the continuity of medical care is at risk when users cannot provide a complete medical history to health professionals they see for the first time.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="Solution">
            <h2>03 Solution</h2>
            <p>Allow users to aggregate their medical records and have easy access to all their health information without having to go through your current healthcare provider.</p>
          </section>

          <section class="Process">
            <h2>04 Process</h2>
            <p>The path to Healthvitae consisted of a detailed and careful study of user research, competitive analysis, user personas, user stories/flows, wireframes, mockups, branding, prototypes and user testing - all with various iterations:</p>
          </section>

          <section class="Process details">
            <h2>User Research Highlights</h2>
            <p>I wanted to find out if there is even a need for a medical records storage application. Is there a desire to have easy access to their medical data, or do people think it doesn’t matter? I as well wanted to find out which age groups would be interested in a health application.</p>
            <p class="research-percentage"> 61%</p>
            <p class="research-data">Of the participants responded that they think often about their health</p>
            <p class="research-percentage">66%</p>
            <p class="research-data">Access Medical Records through healthcare providers web portal or app</p>
            <p class="research-percentage"> 78%</p>
            <p class="research-data">Say that having a medical history (doctor visits, lab results, etc.) would be very positive</p>
            <p class="research-percentage"> 83%</p>
            <p class="research-data">Would be interested in having all of the medical data electronically stored in the same place</p>
            <p class="research-percentage"> 76%</p>
            <p class="research-data">Would like to have dental at the same place stored as medical records</p>
            <p class="research-percentage"> 50%</p>
            <p class="research-data">Are interested in having a medical record of their children at the same place as their own</p>

          <section class="Competitive Analysis">
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>For my medical record cloud storage idea, I looked into three different cloud storage for three specific reasons. <br> Practice Fusion because it is the most popular medical record application in the market, Google Drive because mainly individuals are using it, and my application has the same target audience. Also, lastly DropBox because of its user-friendly interface.</p>
            <div class="three competitors">
            <img src="images/practice-fusion-logo.svg" alt="Practice Fusion icon">
            <p>Practice Fusion is subscription based and cheaper than its competitors. The weakness is the conservative interface and that there is no mobile version available, which gives them opportunities if they would re-design the interface and as well create a mobile app.</p>
            <img src="images/googledrive.svg" alt="Google Drive icon">
            <p>Google Drive is enabling with Google Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets, and an easy way to collaborate. One of the threats is that if competitors find a way to differentiating its storage solution more or match Google’s level of engagement with its customers, then it could be a serious threat to Google Drive.</p>
            <img src="images/dropbox.svg" alt="DropBox">
            <p>DropBox strength is that it has a very user-friendly interface. One of the weaknesses is that they offer less free storage space compared to Google Drive and the security and privacy issues.</p>

            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>Based on the survey and research I did prior I identified two  target audiences: Millennials and Gen X.</p>

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>The second round of user testing worked much better, and I got some helpful feedback about the prototype this time.
              Overall all participants agreed that it looks like a health application, the colors are suited well for it. The things I should improve were:</p>
            <div class="Usability Testing Highlights">
              <h3>Legibility:</h3>
              <ul class="Legibility">

          <section class="Conclusion">
            <h2>05 Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Healthvitae achieves its goal to give users fast and easy access to their medical records. Over the course of many testing sessions and design iterations, we developed a user interface that is simplistic yet modern and easy to operate.
            While I’m pleased with the final solution, I wish my early testing phase would have worked out better. But running into those issues also taught me to do not the same mistakes next time and I also learned the big importance of user testing and what impact that has on your product.</p>

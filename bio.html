        <h4> <span class="Chapter">Chapter One:</span> Raised on VHS tapes</h4>
        <p>I was born in New York but grew up in Switzerland in a tiny village that had more cows than people. I spent my childhood riding horses, building igloos in front of our house in the wintertime, drawing the cows I saw on my way to school and watching Disney movies my godfather sent from America.
        <br> <br>I didn't know exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up,  as my wish always changed. After I watched 101 Dalmatians, my dream was to become a fashion designer. Later I wanted to be an interior designer, and that switched to becoming a painter. What all those wishes had in common was that they were creative professions.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><h4><span class="Chapter">Chapter Two:</span> I have to pee</h4>
        <p>My parents were working their whole life in banking, and my big brother turned out to be a math genius. I weirdly am not the most skilled mathematician myself - My theory is that when all of us kids stood in line while God came around to give us our talents and skills, I probably was in the restroom for the math portion part.  So I missed out on that, and my brother got my share on top of his one. Which is fine because I got, on the other hand, all the creative skills. And my brother couldnâ€™t draw a cow if his life would depend on it.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><h4><span class="Chapter">Chapter Three:</span> Hello old friend</h4>
        <p>After graduating from graphic design school, I decided to move back to America. I planned to live in New York, but after experiencing Hurricane Sandy, I decided to go instead to a warmer location. I packed my things and flew to the City of Angels. My parents were sure that I'd be back in three months, but I've been living here now for 6 years, and it truly became my home.
        <br><br>I studied 3D animation in LA, and after graduating I worked for 2 years at a 3d software company. While working with amazing artists, I realized - to quote Arya Stark - "That's not me." It was fun for a while to be in that world, but at the end of the day, I was missing something.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><h4><span class="Chapter">Chapter Four:</span> Why I chose UI/UX</h4>
        <p>While I tried to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, something caught my attention: I noticed a lot of people had a hard time with the 3d software I worked on. They complained that the interface was confusing and that they didn't want to use the software because of it. Up to this point I never heard of UI/UX design. I had the impression that developers did everything, as was the case at my company, but because of the users asking for a more intuitive design I started researching how to solve this problem and I discovered UI/UX. I was immediately captured by it. Being the voice of the users is such an important (and very needed) role.
        <br><br>That was the reason I chose to make a career change and become a UI/UX designer. I saw first hand how valuable user experience is and what an impact good or weak UI/UX can have. An application can rise or fall depending on its user-friendliness and being able to help a company with that is everything to me.
        <br><br>Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about my cow drawing skills or UI/UX opportunities!</p>

            <h2><span class="NumberStriped">02</span> Problem</h2>
            <p><!--The mothers of rare and undiagnosed disease children is an overlooked and almost invisible population.

              The undiagnosed and rare disease population is overlooked and majority of society doesn't even know that they exist. When you hear rare disease you get the impression that it's rare

              Rare disease is anything but rare. In fact, one in 15 people worldwide could be affected, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
              Yet, for patients and their loved ones, the experience of living with a rare disease can be isolating. There may be as many as 7,000 rare diseases. The total number of Americans living with a rare disease is estimated at between 25-30 million. This estimate has been used by the rare disease community for several decades to highlight that while individual diseases may be rare, the total number of people with a rare disease is large.

            As many as 25 - 30 million Americans – about 1 in 13 people - suffer from a rare, undiagnosed condition.
            Patients see an average of 7.3 physicians before a diagnosis is made, and the length of time from symptom
            onset to an accurate diagnosis is around 4.8 years for a rare disease. More than 50% of rare diseases affect children
            and 30% of patients die before the age of five.

            Up to 15 million children are affected by it in America alone. Worldwide are up to 200 million children

            There may be as many as 7,000 rare diseases and globally there are 400 million people affected by a rare undiagnosed disease.
            while individual diseases may be rare, the total number of people with a rare disease is large.

            It is estimated that worldwide over 200 million children are affected by a rare and undiagnosed diasese. In America alone are up to 15 million children suffering from it.
            Around 200 million children worldwide are affected by a rare and undiagnosed disease. The total number of children in America living with a rare disease is estimated at between 12 - 15 million.
            In America alone, it's believed there are up to 15 million kids living with a rare or undiagnosed condition.

            Each rare disease may only affect a handful of people scattered around the world, but taken together, the number of people directly affected
            is with over 400 million, equivalent to the population of the world's third-largest country.
            More than 50% of those affected are children, and 30% of patients die before the age of five.
            Between 25 and 30 million people in the US have rare diseases, defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 people nationally, according to the National Institutes of Health. Yet, many suffer in isolation.

            A rare disease is a disease that occurs infrequently or rarely in the general population.
            In America, for example, a rare disease is defined as affecting fewer than 200’000 people.
            Paradoxically, although any given rare condition may only affect a few hundred, there are
            between 5000 and 7000 distinct rare diseases identified to date, and altogether it is
            estimated to affect between 25 - 30 million Americans. <br><br>
            Despite this number, the rare disease patient and its family is the orphan of health systems,
            often denied diagnosis, treatment and the benefits of research.  <br><br>
            Rare diseases are often life-threatening. They are chronic, progressive, degenerative, and disabling.
            People living with rare diseases face many common challenges, such as delayed or inaccurate
            diagnosis, difficulty accessing care, and lack of knowledge or access to expertise.

          “[I feel hopeful] when I see my son connect with other kids that have [condition] and are leading full lives.
          When he meets young adults who go on to have succeful careers, despite the disease.
          I wish we had more opportunities for him to meet and stay connected with people such as this.”<br> <br>

          <div class="Solution">
            <h2><span class="NumberStriped">03</span> Solution</h2>
            <p>The original idea was to create a friend finder & community app for the undiagnosed disease community
              (undiagnosed adults and parents of undiagnosed children), with the friendship aspect as the main feature
              and community second. <br>After conducting user interviews, it showed that the app does not solve a problem they want
              to have solved. Their only thought they are having is finding the correct diagnosis to go back to their old life.
              On the other hand, parents are much more likely to accept this as the new normal and are wanting to give their
              children the best quality of life they can. <br><br>

              The research also pointed out that mothers are more affected by their kid's disease. They are the primary caregiver,
              and the women's life changes more than the fathers. Moms are the ones that want to or are already using some online
              support groups and desire to connect with fellow mothers that are in the same situation. <br>The research showed that
              they come for support first and that making friends will happen naturally by bonding over shared experiences.
              This is why we iterated our app and made the community feature our main feature. Also, we changed the target audience to mothers only.
              We opened up our target audience and decided to include mothers of undiagnosed children also.
              97% of rare diseases have no cure - they are in the same limbo as mothers of undiagnosed children.

            <!--  Based on the research studies, we concluded that we should focus on mothers only because they are the primary users interested in online support groups. The research made us aware that mothers are the .</p>-->

              <h2>Hi-Fi Wireframes</h2>
              <p>I took the feedback of my testing and created the wireframes in Figma. I made a clickable prototype and moved then on to the hi-fi mockups. While creating the UI, I decided to go back to the wireframes and to change the HOME screen.

<br><br>Reasoning: The problem I try to solve with my application is to give cats that are less photogenic a chance of getting adopted. That's why I wanted to focus on their personalities and unique quirks. But when I  was working on the hi-fi mockups, I realized that I only show the pictures and names of the adoptable cats on the HOME screen. <br>To get information about their personalities, you have to click on their profiles first. But does that not again benefit cats with better appearances? That's why I decided to rethink my wireframes and change it to show the cat's unique quirks on the HOME screen instead.

              <h2>Concept and Branding</h2>
              <p>I named the app 'More Than Fluffy' because people tend to choose which cat to adopt depending on their looks. With my application, I want to focus on their personalities and show that cats are more than just cute and fluffy.

<br><br>The app name is bold and flashy, and that's why it also needs a vibrant and flashy color to support the feeling and message of the app.

<br><br>Why I chose hot pink for the call to action color: The color pink is the color of universal love of oneself and others. Pink represents friendship, affection, harmony, inner peace, and approachability. And hot pink is also used to communicate playfulness.</p>

              <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
              <p>The second round of user testing worked much better, and I got some helpful feedback about the prototype this time.
                Overall all participants agreed that it looks like a health application, the colors are suited well for it. The things I should improve were:</p><br><br>
              <div class="UsabilityTestingHighlights">
                <ul class="Legibility">
                  <li>Green font is too bright and hard to read</li>
                  <li>Overall font size is on the smaller side</li>
                  <li>Logo is too small</li>
                  <li>Some buttons had outlines and some not. </li>
